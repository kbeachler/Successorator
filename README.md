## Velocity
### MS1 Calculations
6-person team w/ each person working 5 hours per week w/ initial velocity estimate being 0.6
<br>
Iteration one estimated hours: 16 / 0.6 = 26.667
<br>
Actual time spent on Iteration one: 20
<br>
Adjusted velocity: 16 / 20 = 0.8
<br>
Iteration two estimated hours: 25 / 0.8 = 31.25
<br>
Iteration one and two combined hours: 57.917 (less than 2 * 6 * 5 = 60 so no change)

### MS2 Calculations
#### Iteration one:
6-person team w/ each person working 9 hours per week.
<br>
Actual time spent on iteration two in MS-1: 50
<br>
Adjusted velocity: 25/50 = 0.5
<br>
We also increased hours per week as we all had to go overtime for iteration 2 in MS-1.
<br>
Therefore, we can do 6 * 9 * 0.5 = 27 hours of work in each iteration.

#### Iteration two:
6-person team w/ each person working 8 hours per week w velocity being 0.5. 
<br>
Iteration one estimated hours: 26 / 0.5 = 52 hours. 
<br>
Actual time spent on iteration one: 45 hours.
<br>
Adjusted velocity: 26/45 = 0.57
<br>
Iteration two estimated hours: 26 / .47 = 45 
<br>
Iteration one and two combined hours: 97 (2 * 6 * 8 = 96)


The database logic and testing took longer than anticipated. Midterms and other exams interferred with the team's ability to stay on track at times. Creating separate views and logic took less than anticipated once database was refactored. 

Overall, Velocity was accurate for iteration two. Our measurements and caluations have been consistent with our rate of work. We took everyone's time into account for our initial velocity and applied our measured estimations and progress to later iterations to calcuate the time.
